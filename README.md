### WebGL 2 declarations for Typescript

### Known Issues

- There are some conflicts with existing **WebGLRenderingContext**. This method hides until **WebGLRenderingContext** not resolved;
- For complete support of **ImageBitmap** we need more new ***DOM***-declarations such as **WorkerGlobalScope** and **WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope**.
